Count of Ordered Pairs (X, Y) satisfying the Equation 1/X + 1/Y = 1/N
Difficulty Level : Expert
Last Updated : 19 Aug, 2020
Given a positive integer N, the task is to find the number of ordered pairs (X, Y) where both X and Y are positive integers, such that they satisfy the equation 1/X + 1/Y = 1/N.

Examples:

Input: N = 5 
Output: 3 
Explanation: Only 3 pairs {(30,6), (10,10), (6,30)} satisfy the given equation.
 

Input: N = 360 
Output: 105 
 

Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
Approach: 
Follow the steps to solve the problem: 
 




Solve for X using the given equation. 
1/X + 1/Y = 1/N 
=> 1/X = 1/N – 1/Y 
=> 1/X = (Y – N) / NY 
=> X = NY / (Y – N) 
=> X = N + N2 / (Y – N)

Therefore, it can be observed that, to have a positive integer X, the remainder when N2 is divided by (Y – N) needs to be 0.
It can be observed that the minimum value of Y can be N + 1 (so that denominator Y – N > 0) and the maximum value of Y can be N2 + N so that N2/(Y – N) remains a positive integer ≥ 1.
Then iterate over the maximum and minimum possible values of Y, and for each value of Y for which N2 % (Y – N) == 0, increment count.
Finally, return count as the number of ordered pairs.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:

C++
// C++ Program for the above approach 
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
using namespace std; 
  
// Function to find number of ordered 
// positive integer pairs (x,y) such 
// that  they satisfy the equation 
void solve(int n) 
{ 
    // Initialize answer variable 
    int ans = 0; 
  
// Iterate over all possible values of y 
    for (int y = n + 1; y <= n * n + n; y++) { 
  
        // For valid x and y, 
        // (n*n)%(y - n) has to be 0 
        if ((n * n) % (y - n) == 0) { 
  
            // Increment count of ordered pairs 
            ans += 1; 
        } 
    } 
  
    // Print the answer 
    cout << ans; 
} 
  
// Driver Code 
int main() 
{ 
    int n = 5; 
    // Function call 
    solve(n); 
    return 0; 
}
